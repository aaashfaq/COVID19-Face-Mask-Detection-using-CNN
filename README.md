# COVID19-Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN

1. The Data set used for developing the Face Mask Detection model in this project was downloaded from here https://www.kaggle.com/prithwirajmitra/covid-face-mask-detection-dataset

2. Data Augmentation Techniques has been performed to increase the available data

3. A Convolutional Neural Network is Developed to identify non-mask person from people wearing mask

4. Accuray and Loss of the model has been ploted to show the performance of the model
